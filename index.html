            <a>Welcome to my audio engineering portfolio! My name is Brandon Mrgich, and I'm passionate about bringing music to life through the art of mixing and mastering. With years of experience doing this for myself and friends, I've had the privilege of working with a diverse range of artists and genres, helping them achieve the sound they envision for their music.
            
                One of the highlights of my portfolio is the recent mastering of my collaborative album, "Ghosts of the Auditorium: Live Performances for an Empty Theatre", which you can listen to "before & after" version here on the site.
                
                In addition to my own projects, I've also had the opportunity to work with numerous other musicianis, providing mixing and mastering services for a variety of tracks and albums. Whether it's a single, an EP, or a full-length album, I approach each project with the goals of making it easy, and enjoyable to listen to.
                
                On this website, you'll find samples of my work, including snippets from "GOTA", and other projects I've worked on. Feel free to listen to my work and see for yourself! 
                
                Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you on your next music project!
