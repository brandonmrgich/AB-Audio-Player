<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Getting Started

1. Simply add audio files to the assets folder (HTML supports MP3, WAV, and OGG). The files must have the same duration to work correctly.
2. Update the audioData array located in main.js. Add an object containing the A and B audio sources, songName, and artist. Example for two players:
   ```javascript
   const audioData = [
    { audioA: "./assets/sound1-a.mp3", audioB: "./assets/sound1-b.mp3", songName: "Unheard", artist: "Brandon Mrgich with Blueshades"},
    { audioA: "./assets/sound2-a.mp3", audioB: "./assets/sound2-b.mp3", songName: "Sample Audio", artist: "Sample" },
   ];
   ```
3. There are some caveats with different browsers handling how the audio file is preloaded, muted, etc. Test thoroughly for production use.
